# LogicalExpressionSystem
This project includes OOP principles and design patterns.

There are basic expressions such as:
*Val that holds a boolean value
*Var that holds a variable.
Each expression has methods such as evaluate - to evaluate the expression according to a map.
assign - assigning another expression instead of the current variable.
and more..

Val & Var both implements the Expression interface.
